## Reflection

This was a 3 month long project built after my graduation. Project goals included using and technologies like React, Redux familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to somehow plan their work and share it with other people. I got some ideas from jira. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router` and `redux`.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. I ended up using Microsoft Authentication Library(MSAL) as I was able to integrate MSAL into the backend and implement server side authentication and authorization as well.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, ChartJS, React Hooks, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
